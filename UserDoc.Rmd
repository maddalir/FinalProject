# Storm Watch - Help

Storm Watch is an application that enables you to visualize Inclement Weather Activity in the US in the Year 2010. The application, with its controls allows you to narrow down to activity that meets filter criteria.

Three types of Inclement Weather are included in this display; Tornado Activity, Storm Activity and Flood Activity

### Initial Screen

Upon initial load, the application applies no filters and displays a map of all inclement activity during the year. Each dot, represents an inclement weather activity. Clicking on a dot will popup a description of that activity.

### Applying Filters

There are three filters available to help the user narrow down the activities displayed on the map. The filters are compound, which means that the reselts are narrowed down by a combination of all filters.

#### Fatality Count Slider

This filter allows the user to narrow the displayed events to those that had a minimum count of fatalities on the slider. The user must be aware that larger fatalitiy counts are relatively rare and therfore the map points will be more sparse as the user uses the slide to the right.

#### Event Check Box

The Event check box allows you to narrow the events displayed a few months. An empty Event Check Box means all events will be selected.

#### State Multi Select

The State Filter allows you to narrow the events displayed to a list of selected states. An empty State Filter means all states will be chosen in the display

#### Month Check Box

The Month check box allows you to narrow the events displayed to those selected months. An empty Month Check Box means all months will be selected.
